The regimen Capomulin and Ramincane has more tests or data sets than the other regimen.
The mean tumour volume and the final tumour volume is lowest for Capomulin and Ramicane which could be an embedded indirect impact of more data points so its hard to conclude the real impact of the regimen.
The narrow spread of the data on box plots graph for Capomulin and Ramicane is also an impact of more sample points.
The tumour volumes have direct linear corrleation with the mouse weight.
